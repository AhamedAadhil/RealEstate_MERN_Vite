        Hi There I am Ahamed Aathil Junain, From Srilanka. I have created this
        whole web application with the help of my own knowledge, many YouTubers
        and ChatGPT. First of all I would like to extend my thanks to them.
        Cheers mate..
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700">
        To do this website I took nearly just 5 days, even I follow the video in
        Youtube which was 11 hours length. I didnt belive I did complete this
        web application this much of fast, normally I spent 2 to 3 hours a day
        for this project to complete it this fast.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700">
        Hope everyone will enjoy this project if someone clone this code from my
        github repository, for any further doubts and query please dont hesitate
        to contact me through Ahamedaathil.5@gmail.com
      </p>
